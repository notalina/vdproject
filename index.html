      august 11, 2021.

      I remember we were watching anime and I was really upset because you were mad at me or not in the mood. You tickled me. You said I laughed like a little kid. You sad how can you be mad at such cute baby girl. 
      I remember you said you liked how I looked when I put a skirt on. 
      I remember you said I had a beautiful smile.
      I remember you asked me if I want to be called любимая. You asked me as if you were ready to start calling me like that. 
      I remember how you wanted to lift me and actually did that. 
      I remember how we did economy homework together. I was sitting on your lap and you were whispering in my ear what to do. 
      I remember crying on your lap and you cried a little too. You were hugging me. 
      I remember talking to you and laughing all night long. 
      I remember f♡♡♡♡ing and listening to music in earphones. 
      I remember f♡♡♡♡ing and playing everlasting summer. 
      I remember my first slow dancing with you. 
      I remember waking up because you kissed me and called me sleeping beauty. 
      I remember you biting my neck and shoulders while we fucked.
      I remember you calling me pretty a lot. Just like you do with your anime girls.
      I remember kissing on the bench in front of kids and other people. 
      I remember walking in forest and you grabbing my ass. 
      I remember you biting my arms and fingers. 
      I remember lying in the dark in front of you. Your fingers inside of me and lips kissing mine. I wish I could experience that night one more time. 
      I remember you goodbye-kissing me. Thanking me that I was there with you.
      I wish I had more nice things to remember. I wish you did them more. I wish I could kiss you as long as I want right now. I wish I could leave a lovebite on your neck. I wish I could give you much more pleasure when we f♡♡♡♡ed. I wish I could send you prettier nudes.
      I'm looking forward for more nice things.
